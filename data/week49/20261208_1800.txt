ChaeSong-hwa: Hey guys! A local music festival is happening this Saturday! I'm really excited for it! Should we plan out what we want to see? 
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds awesome! Let's definitely check out the lineup and make a plan. Can't wait to enjoy some live music together! 
LiHua: Yes! It's gonna be such a good time. I'm really looking forward to it. What time should we meet? 
WolfgangSchulz: How about we meet an hour before it starts? That way we can grab some food and settle in! 
LiHua: That sounds perfect! I'll bring my camera too, want to capture some cool moments.  Do we have a specific spot in mind to meet?
WolfgangSchulz: Maybe we could meet at the entrance? That way, itll be easy to find each other. What do you think?
LiHua: Sounds good! Let's say 5 pm then? That gives us time to chill a bit before everything kicks off. 
YurikoYamamoto: Awesome! Can't wait to enjoy the vibes and music with all of you! It'll be a great night! 
YurikoYamamoto: Did we decide what we're wearing? I love coordinating outfits for events! 
ChaeSong-hwa: Coordinating outfits sounds fun! I say we keep it casual but maybe with a touch of something bright since its a festival vibe! What do you all think? 
ChaeSong-hwa: I love that idea! A splash of color will definitely add to the fun atmosphere. Can't wait to see what everyone comes up with! 
LiHua: I agree! A colorful vibe will definitely match the festival energy. Lets all send pics of our outfits before we meet! 
YurikoYamamoto: Great idea, Li Hua! I love seeing everyone's outfit choices! It'll be like a mini fashion show before the festival. 
YurikoYamamoto: Hey, let's make sure to bring some snacks too! Festival food can be pricey! 
WolfgangSchulz: Definitely a good idea! We'll save some cash for drinks instead! 
LiHua: I can bring some chips and drinks! It'll be a nice treat while we hang out.
