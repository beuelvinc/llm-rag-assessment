HaileyJohnson: Hey Li Hua! Hope you're doing well!  Just wanted to let you know we're having a special summer promotion on ice cream and pastries! What are your favorite summer dessert flavors? 
LiHua: Hey Hailey! That sounds awesome! I'm a big fan of anything fruity, especially mango and coconut. And I can't resist some good old chocolate too. What do you have planned for the promotion? 
HaileyJohnson: Love those choices! Mango and coconut sound super refreshing for summer.  We're planning to whip up some fruity ice cream flavors and maybe a mango-coconut pastry! Plus, we'll have some chocolate treats too. Can't wait! What do you think? 
LiHua: Wow, that sounds amazing! I'm definitely looking forward to trying those fruity options you mentioned. Cant wait to stop by and grab some of those treats! 
HaileyJohnson: Yay! I'm so excited for you to try them!  When you come by, I'll have something special made just for you. Thanks for your support, Li Hua!
