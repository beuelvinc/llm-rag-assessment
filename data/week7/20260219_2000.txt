LiHua: Hey Adam! Hope youre doing well. I was wondering if I could add some decorations to the basement, like some sound-insulating pads. What do you think?
AdamSmith: Hi Li Hua! That sounds like a great idea. As long as its reversible and doesnt damage anything, Im okay with it. Let me know if you need any help!
LiHua: Awesome, thanks for that! I promise to keep it reversible and neat. Ill let you know if I need anything!
AdamSmith: Great! Looking forward to seeing how it turns out. Enjoy the decorating!
