WolfgangSchulz: Man, that jam session was awesome! I feel so pumped and refreshed. It's been ages since I played like that. We should do it more often! 
LiHua: Totally agree! It was such a blast jamming together. Can't believe we waited so long to do that again! We should definitely make it a regular thing. How about next weekend? 
WolfgangSchulz: Next weekend sounds perfect! Lets pick a day and time that works for both of us. I cant wait to see what we come up with next! 
LiHua: How about Saturday afternoon? We can play for a while and maybe grab some food afterward too! What do you think? 
WolfgangSchulz: Saturday afternoon is great! I'm down for both jamming and grabbing some food afterward. It'll be a fun day!
