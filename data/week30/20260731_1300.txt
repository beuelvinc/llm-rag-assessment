HaileyJohnson: Hey Li Hua!  I'm planning a bread-tasting event at the bakery and would love your help gathering feedback from our customers. Do you think you could assist with that? It would mean a lot! 
LiHua: Sure! I'd be happy to help with that. When's the event happening? 
HaileyJohnson: Awesome! The event will be on Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm. Do you think you can come by during that time? Itll be a lot of fun! 
LiHua: I can definitely make it! Just let me know what you need me to do. Can't wait! 
HaileyJohnson: Great! Ill probably need you to chat with customers and collect their thoughts on the different breads. Maybe even jot down some favorites! Sound good?
