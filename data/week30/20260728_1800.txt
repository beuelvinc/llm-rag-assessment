WolfgangSchulz: Hey Li Hua!  I was thinking we could pick up a new hobby together to unwind a bit from work stress. How about pottery or painting? Sounds fun, right? 
LiHua: That sounds like a great idea! Ive been wanting to try painting for a while now. What do you think, should we start there? 
WolfgangSchulz: Painting it is then! We can explore some techniques and just have fun with it.  When do you want to get started?
LiHua: How about this weekend? We can gather some supplies and spend the day painting together! 
WolfgangSchulz: This weekend works for me! Lets make it a fun day. Cant wait to see what we come up with! 
LiHua: Same here! It'll be a blast!  Lets plan to meet at my place and we can set everything up. See you then!
