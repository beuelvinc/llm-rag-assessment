JenniferMoore: Hey Li Hua!  Just wanted to say congrats on pushing your limits with the bench press this week! You've been making awesome progress! Keep it up! 
LiHua: Thanks, Jennifer! I appreciate the encouragement! Feeling strong and motivated!  Any tips for next session?
JenniferMoore: For sure! Lets focus on form and control during the next session. Maybe we can add some progressive overload to gradually increase weight. You've got this! 
LiHua: Sounds great! I'll definitely keep an eye on my form. Can't wait for the next session! 
JenniferMoore: Awesome! Cant wait to see what you achieve! Remember to rest and fuel up. See you next time!
