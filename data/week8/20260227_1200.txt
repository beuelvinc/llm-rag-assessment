WolfgangSchulz: Hey! So, I can't make it for our jam session tomorrow afternoon. Work's been a bit crazy! Would you be cool with moving it to Sunday night instead? Let me know!
LiHua: No worries at all! Sunday night works just fine for me. Looking forward to it! 
WolfgangSchulz: Awesome! Can't wait to get back into it. It's been too long since I played. See you then! 
LiHua: For sure! It'll be great to jam together again. Got any new songs in mind? 
WolfgangSchulz: I've been thinking about revisiting some classics and maybe adding in a few twists. What about you? Any fresh ideas?
LiHua: I've got a few new riffs I've been working on. Can't wait to share them! It's gonna be epic! 
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds great! New riffs always get me hyped. Cant wait to hear them!
