ChaeSong-hwa: Hey everyone! Ive been thinking itd be cool to explore fusion music! How about we try mixing jazz elements with rock? It could add a whole new vibe to our sound!  What do you all think?
WolfgangSchulz: That sounds like a fun idea! Jazz and rock can create some really unique rhythms. Let's experiment with different styles this Sunday and see what we come up with!
YurikoYamamoto: Totally agree! Mixing those genres could bring out some amazing creativity. We could start with a classic rock song and add some jazz chords or improvisation. It'll be fun! 
WolfgangSchulz: Yeah, let's see what we can blend together! I'm excited to jam and figure out some cool transitions. I bet it will take our music to a whole new level. Can't wait for Sunday! 
WolfgangSchulz: Lets also think about which songs we could try that would work well with jazz elements. Any suggestions?
YurikoYamamoto: How about we start with a rock classic like "Smoke on the Water" or "Back in Black"? We could reimagine them with a jazzy twist, maybe throw in some improvisation too! What do you think?
