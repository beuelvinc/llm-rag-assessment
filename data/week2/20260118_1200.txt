WolfgangSchulz: Sounds amazing! Ill aim to be there around 6. Cant wait to celebrate with you! Do you need any help with anything? 
LiHua: Awesome, 6 it is! Just bring yourself and your appetite!  Everything else is under control. Got any plans for after dinner?
WolfgangSchulz: Not really, just enjoying the festivities with good food and company sounds perfect. Maybe we could play some games or watch something afterward?  What do you think?
LiHua: That sounds like a blast! I'm down for some games or a movie after dinner. Got any favorites in mind? 
WolfgangSchulz: How about we check out that new movie everyone's talking about? Or we could fire up some classic multiplayer games for nostalgia. Your call! 
LiHua: Both sound great! Lets do the movie first and then switch to games later! Ill get the snacks ready! 
WolfgangSchulz: Perfect combo! I'll bring some drinks to go with your snacks. Looking forward to a fun night!  See you soon!
