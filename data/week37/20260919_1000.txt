JenniferMoore: Awesome! Youre doing great! Keep it up, and let me know if you need any tips on protein sources. 
LiHua: Will do! I appreciate the support. By the way, any fun plans for the weekend? 
JenniferMoore: Just catching up on some reading and maybe a hike! How about you? Any activities lined up?
