LiHua: Hey buddy! It seems like we have never talked about our favorite fast food although both of us are fast food lovers.
WolfgangSchulz: Im all about those burgers and fries! Can't beat a classic cheeseburger. Whats your go-to order? 
LiHua: I'm a big fan of spicy chicken sandwiches! They hit the spot every time. Do you have a favorite fast food spot? 
WolfgangSchulz: Totally love that! For me, it's gotta be that little burger joint downtown. The shakes there are amazing too! What do you think?
LiHua: Oh, Ive heard good things about that place! Their shakes must be fantastic. I usually go for the drive-thru after gym sessions.  Do you have a favorite shake flavor?
WolfgangSchulz: Im all about chocolate shakes. They just make everything better! What about you? Anything unique you like?
LiHua: I love vanilla shakes, but I sometimes mix it up with strawberry! Just gives that extra kick. Have you tried that combo? 
WolfgangSchulz: I havent tried that combo yet, but it sounds delicious! Gotta give it a shot next time. Thanks for the suggestion!
