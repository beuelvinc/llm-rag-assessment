LiHua: Hey! What do you think about playing "Wonderwall" this Sunday? I feel like it would be a fun jam! 
WolfgangSchulz: "Wonderwall" sounds great! Itll be awesome to groove to that one together. How about mixing it up with Hey Jude too?
LiHua: "Hey Jude" is a classic! I love that idea. We could really get into it and have a good time. Any other songs you're thinking about?
WolfgangSchulz: How about we throw in "Come Together" as well? I think it would be a nice addition to our set! 
LiHua: "Come Together" would definitely add some cool vibes! I'm all in for that. Lets make this Sunday a blast! 
WolfgangSchulz: Can't wait! Its gonna be a fun night. Lets nail down the parts we want to focus on before then. 
LiHua: Good plan! We can go over the key parts and figure out our roles. Itll make the practice smoother. See you Sunday!
