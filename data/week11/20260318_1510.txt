LiHua: Hey Yuriko!  I was wondering if you'd like to join Wolfgang and me for some music jam sessions every Sunday night? We have a lot of fun playing together, and I think you'd fit right in with your bass skills! Let me know what you think! 
YurikoYamamoto: That sounds amazing! I'd love to join you guys for some jamming sessions! What time do you usually start? 
LiHua: Awesome! We usually kick things off around 8 pm. It'll be a great time! Cant wait to see what you bring to the group. 
YurikoYamamoto: Perfect! 8 pm works for me. I'm really looking forward to it! Any specific songs you want to play? 
LiHua: Great! We usually just go with the flow and play some of our favorites. Ill let Wolfgang know too! Itll be fun to explore different songs together! 
YurikoYamamoto: Sounds like a plan! I really enjoy trying out new songs. Let me know if there's anything specific I should bring along! 
LiHua: Just bring your bass and your awesome vibe! We'll figure out the rest when we meet. Can't wait!
