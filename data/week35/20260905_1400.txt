WolfgangSchulz: Hey man, this new software project is really pushing me to my limits. I feel like Im constantly in a pressure cooker. 
LiHua: I totally hear you, dude. Just remember, this pressure wont last forever. You're super talented, and I believe in you! Just take it one step at a time. 
WolfgangSchulz: Thanks, man! Im trying to stay focused, but some days just feel overwhelming. I cant wait for our jam tomorrow to let off some steam! 
LiHua: Totally! Jamming out will be a great way to relieve some stress. Plus, it's always fun playing together. What do you want to work on this time? 
WolfgangSchulz: I was thinking we could have some fun with "Here Comes the Sun" again. It's such a feel-good song! 
LiHua: Sounds awesome! That song always brightens up the mood. Can't wait to play it with everyone! It's gonna be a blast.
