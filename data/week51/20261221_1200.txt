WolfgangSchulz: Hey everyone! Just a heads-up, I won't be able to make it to practice this week. I have a business trip to Hong Kong. Catch you all next time!
WolfgangSchulz: Hope you all have a great jam without me! Looking forward to hearing what you come up with. 
YurikoYamamoto: Aww, Wolfgang, we'll miss you! But safe travels! We'll make sure to save some cool tunes for when you're back! 
WolfgangSchulz: Thanks! I appreciate it. I'll be eager to catch up once I'm back and hear all the new stuff! 
WolfgangSchulz: Li Hua, make sure you all have enough fun for me! Got any songs lined up for this week?
YurikoYamamoto: Let's see how it goes! Maybe we can try something new. How about "Chasing Cars" or "Tears in Heaven"? What do you think?
ChaeSong-hwa: Sounds great! Those songs would be awesome to try out. Have fun! Can't wait to hear how it goes!
WolfgangSchulz: Cant wait to hear it too! Keep the vibes going while I'm away. Lets save those tunes for my return! 
LiHua: Btw, do you guys want to try some new harmonies in "Chasing Cars"? I think it would sound amazing!
YurikoYamamoto: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Harmonies always add such a nice touch. Let's give it a shot! 
LiHua: Chae, you think we can also add some cool rhythms? I'm ready to get creative!
ChaeSong-hwa: Absolutely! I love the idea of mixing in some cool rhythms. Itll make our sound even more exciting! Cant wait to see how it turns out!
YurikoYamamoto: Yes! It's going to be so fun. I'm looking forward to our practice this week! 
ChaeSong-hwa: Just a reminder to share voice notes or recordings so Wolfgang can join in remotely! Would love to keep him in the loop!
LiHua: Great idea! I'll make sure to take some recordings. Wolfgang, you won't miss out on any jams! 
WolfgangSchulz: Thanks, everyone! You guys have fun and I'll catch up once I'm back. Don't forget to send me the recordings!  I'm excited to hear everything! You all have fun jamming!
