WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Want to check out "Overwatch 3" tomorrow? Should be fun! 
LiHua: Sounds awesome! I'm totally in! What time are we thinking? 
WolfgangSchulz: Great! How about we catch the 7 PM show? Gives us time to grab some food before. 
LiHua: 7 PM works for me! Food first sounds like a plan! Lets pick a place we both like. Any thoughts? 
WolfgangSchulz: How about that new burger place near the cinema? I've heard good things! 
LiHua: That sounds delicious! I've been wanting to try it. Lets do it! See you tomorrow!
