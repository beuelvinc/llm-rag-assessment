LiHua: Hey! I decided I need to get a guitar this afternoon. Want to join me? It'll be fun! 
WolfgangSchulz: Oh, that sounds awesome! I havent been out to check out music gear in ages. What kind of guitar are you thinking about? 
LiHua: Im not sure yet, maybe a good acoustic? I just want something that feels right. Want to hit a couple of stores together? 
WolfgangSchulz: Yeah, lets do it! Trying out a few could be cool. I cant wait to hear your plans for jamming with it!
LiHua: For sure! I can already picture some jam sessions!  Lets meet up around 2?
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds good! Ill see you then!
