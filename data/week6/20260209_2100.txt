LiHua: Hey!  I finally secured that difficult client! Feels like a big win! By the way, do you have some time to hit the slopes? 
WolfgangSchulz: That's awesome news!  Congrats! But yeah, Im swamped with work right now no time for skiing. Maybe next weekend?
LiHua: I totally understand, work can be crazy sometimes! Just wanted to get out there and enjoy the snow. Let's definitely plan for next weekend! Got any other fun plans this week?
WolfgangSchulz: Ill probably just be buried in code this week.  Gotta keep up with everything. How about you? Any plans aside from skiing?
LiHua: Im just focusing on my fitness journey and working on a few projects. Trying to stay active, you know?  Plus, exploring new spots in the city whenever I can. Let me know when you're free!
WolfgangSchulz: That sounds great! Staying active is the way to go. Just keep me posted if you find any cool spots. I might be able to join in a few weeks! 
LiHua: Absolutely! I'll keep you updated on any cool finds. Can't wait to hang out again soon!
