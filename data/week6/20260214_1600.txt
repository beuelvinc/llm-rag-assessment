LiHua: Hey Jennifer! Quick question for you. What's your opinion on the best type of protein supplement that could help me with my fitness goals? Thanks!
JenniferMoore: Hey Li Hua! For your goals, Id recommend looking into whey protein. Its great for muscle recovery and building lean mass. If youre looking for something plant-based, pea or rice protein can also be good options. Just make sure you check the ingredients for added sugars or fillers! 
LiHua: Thanks for the tips! I'll definitely look into whey and maybe the plant-based options too. Do you think it's better to take it before or after workouts?
JenniferMoore: After workouts is generally better! Your muscles are primed to absorb the protein for recovery. Just try to have it within 30-60 minutes post-workout for the best results. If you have it before, just keep it light. Remember hydration is key too! 
LiHua: Got it! Ill focus on post-workout for sure. Appreciate your help! Excited for our next training session! 
JenniferMoore: Cant wait to see you! Lets crush it together on Tuesday!
