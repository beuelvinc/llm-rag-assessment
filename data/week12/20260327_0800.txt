Rosemary focaccia sounds amazing! Ill definitely think about it. Maybe Ill give it a shot next week! Do you recommend any good toppings for it?
HaileyJohnson: You're welcome! I'm so glad to hear that! 

For the rosemary focaccia, you can't go wrong with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt. You could also top it with some cherry tomatoes or olives for an extra burst of flavor! Let me know if you want to give it a try!

Looking forward to enjoying it next week! Hope you have a great day!
