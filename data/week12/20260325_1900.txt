JenniferMoore: Hey Li Hua!  I just wanted to check in on how you've been feeling about your progress this month. Im really impressed with your commitment! 

For next month, I think focusing on strengthening your lower limbs would be awesome. Itll really help with overall stability and performance. What do you think? 
LiHua: Thanks, Jennifer! I've actually been feeling pretty good about my progress. Lower limb exercises sound great. Im definitely up for that! Do you have specific workouts in mind?
JenniferMoore: Awesome to hear you're feeling good!  We can incorporate some squats, lunges, and maybe some deadlifts into our sessions. Ill also make sure to add some balance work to keep things fun! How does that sound? 
LiHua: Sounds perfect! I like the idea of adding balance work too. Itll keep things interesting. Im looking forward to the next session! Do you think we should adjust the plan to include additional reps or sets?
JenniferMoore: Absolutely! We can gradually increase the reps and sets each week to ensure you're building strength.  Just remember to listen to your body and we can always adjust if needed. Ill prepare a new plan for our sessions! Lets crush it!
