WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Got an extra ticket for a concert on March 7th at 6 PM. Wanna join me? Would be awesome to catch up and enjoy some live music!
LiHua: That sounds amazing! I'm totally in! Can't wait!  
WolfgangSchulz: Awesome! It'll be a great time. I could use a break from all the coding. Got any favorite bands performing?
LiHua: Not sure about the lineup, but Im always up for discovering new music! Lets see what surprises they have for us!  
WolfgangSchulz: Sounds good! Always fun to explore new music together. Lets make a plan for the day, maybe grab some food before the concert?
LiHua: Definitely! A pre-concert meal sounds perfect. Do you have a place in mind, or should we try somewhere new? 
WolfgangSchulz: How about we try that new place on Main St? I've heard good things about it! Plus, its not too far from the venue. What do you think?
LiHua: Sounds great! Im always up for checking out new spots. Looking forward to it!  
WolfgangSchulz: Perfect! It'll be a fun night. Can't wait to enjoy some good food and music together!
