LiHua: Hey! Yeah, Ive definitely noticed some improvements. I feel like I have more stamina during workouts and I'm really enjoying the sessions! The current plan is working well for me. Thanks for your guidance! Hows everything on your end?

LiHua: I'm thinking of focusing a bit more on increasing my strength and maybe some flexibility too! I feel like those areas could use some work. Any suggestions on how to approach that?
JenniferMoore: Definitely! For strength, we can incorporate more resistance training into your routine. As for flexibility, adding some dedicated stretching or yoga sessions would really help. We can tweak your current plan to include those. Sound good? 
LiHua: That sounds perfect! I'm excited to try it out. Thanks for being so supportive! Looking forward to our next session!
