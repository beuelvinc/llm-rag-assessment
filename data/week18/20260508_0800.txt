HaileyJohnson: Hey Li Hua! Just a quick reminder that it's Mothers Day this weekend! Ive got a special promotion happening.  Any plans for celebrations? 
LiHua: Sounds great! What's the promotion about? I might grab something for my landlord too.
HaileyJohnson: Im offering 15% off all pastries and special cakes for Mothers Day! Perfect for a treat or a surprise.  Plus, if you order today, Alice can deliver it fresh to your doorstep. Let me know if youre interested!
LiHua: That sounds delicious! I think Ill take advantage of that offer. Can I get a little mix of pastries? What's your top recommendation?
HaileyJohnson: Absolutely! I recommend trying our raspberry-filled croissants and the chocolate eclairs  theyre always a hit!  How many would you like?
LiHua: I'll take a dozen of each! Can you deliver them to my place around 8 am on Monday?
