LiHua: Hey everyone!  I'm really glad we could all connect here. Chae, Wolfgang and Yuriko are amazing! I hope we can all enjoy some good conversations and maybe plan some fun get-togethers. What do you all think?
LiHua: So, Chae, do you play any instruments or have any hobbies? It'd be cool to know more about what you enjoy! 
ChaeSong-hwa: I love singing and used to be in a musical club back in college!  I still enjoy warm songs. How about you guys? Any musical interests?
LiHua: That's awesome, Chae! We're all into music here.  I play guitar and have jam sessions with Wolfgang and Yuriko every Sunday! Yuriko loves playing bass, and Wolfgang used to drum in a band. What kind of music do you like to sing?
YurikoYamamoto: Oh, that's so cool!  I love a mix of genres, but I really enjoy classic rock and acoustic songs. They have such great melodies! Do you have a favorite song to perform?
YurikoYamamoto: I think classic rock would suit your voice perfectly!  If you ever want to collaborate on a song or sing together during our jam sessions, I'm totally in!
ChaeSong-hwa: I appreciate the offer! Collaboration sounds fun! I'm open to a variety of genres, so lets see what we can come up with together.  Would be great to jam on some classic rock songs!
WolfgangSchulz: Nice! Classic rock is always a hit.  Just let me know if you want to try something specific during one of our sessions!
WolfgangSchulz: Looking forward to it! Lets make our Sundays even more fun with some new tunes! 
LiHua: Yeah! I can't wait to hear what we come up with together. It'll be a blast! Let's keep the good vibes going! 
LiHua: Do you guys have any favorite classic rock songs in mind for our next jam? 
ChaeSong-hwa: I really enjoy "Hotel California!" It's such a classic. What about you guys? Any other favorites we should consider?
ChaeSong-hwa: "The Joker" by Steve Miller Band is one of my all-time favorites! It's super catchy and fun to sing along to.  What do you think?
LiHua: That's a great choice! I love "Hotel California" too!  Maybe we could mix it up and create a little medley? What do you all think?
YurikoYamamoto: That sounds exciting! A medley would be awesome! We could blend different vibes and make it really special!  Any other songs you'd like to add?
ChaeSong-hwa: Lets definitely keep brainstorming for our medley! I think a bit of "Sweet Home Alabama" could fit nicely in there. What do you guys think? 
LiHua: Perfect! "Sweet Home Alabama" would add such a fun vibe to our medley!  I'm getting excited about our next jam session already! 
LiHua: What about "Blackbird"? It's acoustic and would fit well! 
WolfgangSchulz: "Blackbird" is a beautiful choice! It would bring a nice contrast to our medley.  I love it!
ChaeSong-hwa: I'm really loving all these song ideas! We'll have such a great time putting this medley together. Can't wait for Sunday! 
YurikoYamamoto: It's going to be an awesome jam! I'm really looking forward to it! Let's bring all the energy! 
LiHua: Definitely! It's going to be a memorable session, everyone! Let's rock it! 
WolfgangSchulz: Can't wait! See you all Sunday!
