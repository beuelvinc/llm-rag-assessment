Turalyon: Hey everyone! Just a quick update, all the benches are installed now!  But the paint isnt dry yet, so please dont sit on them for now. Lets keep them looking good! 
LiHua: Thanks for the update! Can't wait to sit on those benches once they're ready! 
Thrall: Sounds awesome! Also, are we planning on putting any decorations around the benches? Maybe some pretty plants or lights? 
LiHua: That could be a cool idea! A little greenery would definitely enhance the vibe. 
IllidanStormrage: Some lights would be great for evening hangs too! We might want to make sure theyre kid-friendly since we've got that play area coming up. 
RexxarRemar: Yeah, for sure! Itd be nice to have a cozy atmosphere in the garden when the sun goes down. Maybe some solar-powered fairy lights?
