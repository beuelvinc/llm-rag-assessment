ChaeSong-hwa: Ugh, I really want to do karaoke again, but work is just crazy right now!  We need to plan another session soon, its been too long! How about next weekend?
LiHua: I totally get it! Life gets so busy sometimes.  Next weekend sounds great! Can't wait to sing our hearts out! 
ChaeSong-hwa: Yay! Looking forward to it! Lets pick some fun songs to sing.  Any favorites you want to add to the list?
LiHua: I'm thinking we should definitely do some classics! Maybe "I Will Survive" or something upbeat like "Sweet Caroline"? What do you think? 
ChaeSong-hwa: Those are great choices! "Sweet Caroline" is always a crowd-pleaser.  I'm also in the mood for something like "Dancing Queen." What do you think?
LiHua: "Dancing Queen" is a must! It's such a fun song to belt out!  Let's make a killer playlist for next weekend! 
ChaeSong-hwa: Absolutely! Ill gather some more song ideas during the week. Its going to be so much fun!
