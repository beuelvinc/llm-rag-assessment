LiHua: Hey Wolfgang! Just moved to this city and Im loving the vibe so far! Its got such a unique character. Anything cool happening this weekend that I should check out? 
WolfgangSchulz: Hey! Glad to hear youre enjoying it! This weekend, there's a local festival downtown with food stalls and live music. Also, a few art exhibits are opening up if youre into that. Should be fun! Let me know if you want to go together.
LiHua: That sounds awesome! Im definitely up for the festival and art exhibits. Itll be great to explore with you! What time are you thinking of heading out? 
WolfgangSchulz: How about we meet up around 2 PM? That'll give us plenty of time to check out the food stalls before the crowds hit. Plus, we can catch some live music later! What do you think?
LiHua: 2 PM sounds perfect! Im looking forward to trying all the food and soaking in the music. Cant wait to hang out! 
WolfgangSchulz: Same here! It'll be fun to catch up and explore together. Let me know if you need any recommendations or tips for getting around the area. See you soon!
LiHua: Will do! Thanks for the offer! Excited for our adventure this weekend!
