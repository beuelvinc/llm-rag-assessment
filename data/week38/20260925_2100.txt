JakeWatson: Hey Li Hua! I remember last time you asked me how to improve your leg strength. I would say try doing squats and lunges! They really help with your power on the field. Also, don't forget to stretch after your workouts to keep those muscles flexible! 
LiHua: That sounds great! Ill definitely add squats and lunges to my routine. Thanks for the tips! Do you have any favorite stretches you recommend?
JakeWatson: Absolutely! I love doing the hamstring stretch and quad stretch. They target those key areas for soccer! Just hold each stretch for about 30 seconds. Youll feel great afterward! 
LiHua: Got it! I'll make sure to include those. Are you planning to hit the field this weekend? 
JakeWatson: Yeah, definitely! How about we gather the group for a practice session? Would be great to have you join and show off those new tips! 
LiHua: Sounds awesome! I'm in! Just let me know the time and place, and I'll be there!
JakeWatson: Cool! Lets say Saturday at 4 PM at the usual spot? Cant wait to see you there! 
LiHua: Perfect! See you at 4 PM on Saturday! Looking forward to it!
