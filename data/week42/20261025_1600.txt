LiHua: Hey man! I have been looking at some beautiful pictures of Europe this afternoon. I remember you have been to Europe before, right? What are some of the places that really struck you?
WolfgangSchulz: Oh man, I've seen some stunning places in Europe! The fjords in Norway are breathtaking, you cant beat those views. Have you ever thought about the lavender fields in Provence? They're like a sea of purple! 
LiHua: Totally! The lavender fields are such a vibe. I've also heard the beaches in Amalfi Coast are unreal. The colors of the water against the cliffs are just next level!  Whats your favorite place?
WolfgangSchulz: I've always been a fan of the streets of Prague. The architecture is just magical, especially at night. Plus, the vibe of the old town is something else! 
LiHua: Prague sounds amazing! I've seen pictures and it looks so charming. Id love to wander around that old town square. Speaking of which, have you tried any local dishes there? I hear they're delicious! 
WolfgangSchulz: I didn't get a chance to try much when I was there, but I remember the goulash being really hearty and tasty! Can't go wrong with that. Also, those pastries with powdered sugar...yum! 
LiHua: Yum, goulash sounds comforting! And those pastries? I would definitely be all over that. Can't believe how much food varies from place to place in Europe, it's like a feast for the senses! Whats one dish youve really enjoyed from your travels? 
WolfgangSchulz: I had the best risotto when I was in Venice. It was creamy and had seafood in it, just perfection! And you know how I love anything with seafood. 
LiHua: Seafood risotto in Venice sounds heavenly! Ive always wanted to try authentic Italian food straight from there. Speaking of which, have you thought about planning a trip back to Italy? 
WolfgangSchulz: Definitely on my list! Theres so much more to explore, and the food adventure alone would be worth it. Plus, Id love to revisit some of those beautiful coastal towns. 
LiHua: That sounds like a perfect plan! Coastal towns in Italy are known for their charm and stunning views. A trip filled with beautiful scenery and incredible food is hard to beat! Planning to hit any specific spots? 
WolfgangSchulz: Id love to check out Cinque Terre! Those colorful villages along the coast just look amazing. Hiking between them would be such a treat too! 
LiHua: Cinque Terre is a dream! The hiking trails with those views must be incredible. Plus, the seafood there is supposed to be fresh and delicious! Can't wait to hear all about it when you go!
