RexxarRemar: Hey folks, what do you all think about organizing some music for the picnic? A little background music could really set the mood! 
TirionFordring: Music sounds like a great touch! It will really enhance the atmosphere and create a joyful vibe.  Just make sure it's not too loud, so we dont disturb anyone nearby.
TirionFordring: Also, please consider bringing some blankets or chairs for seating, since it might get a bit crowded!

MuradinBronzebeard: I think we should have a mix of snacks and drinks to keep everyone energized. Maybe someone could handle desserts too?  What do you guys think?
RexxarRemar: Desserts would definitely be a hit!  Maybe we can have a little competition for who can bring the best treat? That could be fun! 
RexxarRemar: Oh, and lets make sure to have some water and drinks available to keep everyone hydrated! It might get warm out there. 
TirionFordring: Good point! Staying hydrated is key, especially if we're outside for a while. Maybe we can set up a small drink station with water and some refreshments?
