LiHua: Wow, that looks amazing!  I love the design! I'll have to save up a bit for that, but it could totally be worth it. Thanks for sharing, man!
WolfgangSchulz: No problem! I can totally see you rocking that guitar. Let's keep jamming! 
LiHua: For sure! I can't wait for our next session. What are we playing this week? 
WolfgangSchulz: Thinking we could try something new this week! Maybe something by The Beatles?  What do you think?
LiHua: That sounds great! Maybe "Come Together" again? Everyone loved that last time! 
WolfgangSchulz: We could definitely do that! Plus, it's a fun one to play. Looking forward to it!
